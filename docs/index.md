## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, thank you!

There a few ways to do this:
- With a GitHub account invited to this Organisation, you can add files (tutorials etc) and publish website changes
    - To add files to the website, go to the docs folder and create or upload a file
    - Commit this change using the button, writing a short description of your change
    - Link your file on the website, by editing 'mkdocs.yml' and listing your file information in the how to guides section
- Without permissions, you can submit text files, word docs, markdown files to admin and they can be uploaded on your behalf
