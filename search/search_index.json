The goal is to interpolate data from one grid to another, which is essential for comparing datasets, combining products, or preparing data for models. In this tutorial, we'll use the Python package xESMF to regrid 2D NetCDF datasets. xESMF is built on top of xarray and ESMF, providing a simple interface for regridding with various algorithms. Prerequisites Install the required packages: mamba install xarray xesmf 1. Loading a NetCDF Dataset We'll use xarray to open NetCDF files. Here, we assume you have a 2D variable (e.g., satellite data) with latitude and longitude coordinates. import xarray as xr ds = xr.open_dataset('input_data.nc') print(ds) Plotting the Input Data import matplotlib.pyplot as plt ds['your_variable'].plot() plt.title('Original Data on Source Grid') plt.show() 2. Defining the Target Grid You need to define the grid you want to regrid to. This can be another dataset's grid, or you can create a new one. Here, we create a regular lat/lon grid: import numpy as np target_grid = xr.Dataset({ 'lat': (['lat'], np.arange(-90, 90.1, 1.0)), 'lon': (['lon'], np.arange(0, 360, 1.0)), }) Visualizing the Target Grid plt.figure() plt.scatter(target_grid['lon'], target_grid['lat'], s=1) plt.xlabel('Longitude') plt.ylabel('Latitude') plt.title('Target Grid Points') plt.show() 3. Regridding with xESMF xESMF supports several regridding methods: Choosing a Regridding Algorithm The choice of algorithm depends on your data and scientific goals: Bilinear : Uses weighted averages of the four nearest grid points. It is smooth and works well for continuous variables (e.g., temperature, pressure). However, it does not conserve the total sum of the variable, so it is not suitable for fluxes or quantities where conservation is important. Conservative : Ensures that the integral (sum) of the variable is preserved during regridding. This is essential for variables like precipitation, runoff, or any fluxes. It requires both source and target grids to define cell boundaries (i.e., grid must be defined by cell centers and edges). It can be sensitive to missing values (NaNs), which may cause the output to be NaN if any input cell is NaN. Conservative-normed : Similar to conservative, but normalizes the weights so that if some source cells are NaN, the valid part of the cell is still used. This is especially useful for satellite data or observational products with missing values, as it avoids propagating NaNs unnecessarily. Use this when you want conservation but need to handle missing data robustly. Nearest_s2d / nearest_d2s : Assigns the value of the nearest source (or destination) grid cell. This is fast and preserves original values, but can introduce blocky artifacts. Use for categorical data (e.g., land/sea masks, land cover types) or when you want to avoid interpolation. Patch : A higher-order method that can provide smoother results for some variables, but is less commonly used and more computationally intensive. Summary Table Algorithm Preserves Integrals Handles NaNs Well Smooth Use For bilinear No Moderate Yes Continuous fields conservative Yes No No Fluxes, precipitation conservative-normed Yes Yes No Fluxes with missing data nearest_s2d/d2s No Yes No Categorical, masks patch No Moderate Yes Advanced, smooth fields Example: Bilinear Regridding import xesmf as xe regridder = xe.Regridder(ds, target_grid, 'bilinear') regridded = regridder(ds['your_variable']) regridded.to_netcdf('output_bilinear.nc') Example: Conservative Regridding regridder_cons = xe.Regridder(ds, target_grid, 'conservative') regridded_cons = regridder_cons(ds['your_variable']) regridded_cons.to_netcdf('output_conservative.nc') Example: Conservative-normed Regridding The conservative-normed method is designed to handle missing values (NaNs) more robustly than standard conservative regridding. In the standard conservative method, if any part of a source cell is NaN, the entire destination cell may become NaN. The conservative-normed method normalizes the weights so that only the valid (non-NaN) fraction of the source cell contributes to the destination cell, preventing unnecessary propagation of NaNs. Using a 'mask' Layer To take full advantage of conservative-normed, you should provide a mask variable in your xarray dataset. This mask should be a DataArray with the same shape as your data, where valid data points are marked as 1 (or True) and missing/invalid points as 0 (or False). xESMF will use this mask to determine which parts of the grid are valid during regridding. Example of adding a mask: import numpy as np # Suppose ds['your_variable'] contains NaNs for missing data mask = (~np.isnan(ds['your_variable'])).astype(int) ds['mask'] = (ds['your_variable'].dims, mask) # Now use conservative-normed regridder_normed = xe.Regridder(ds, target_grid, 'conservative_normed') regridded_normed = regridder_normed(ds['your_variable']) regridded_normed.to_netcdf('output_conservative_normed.nc') If you do not provide a mask, xESMF will infer it from the NaN pattern in your data, but explicitly providing a mask is more robust and recommended for complex or irregular missing data patterns. For more, see the xESMF documentation on masking . Example: Nearest Neighbor Regridding regridder_nn = xe.Regridder(ds, target_grid, 'nearest_s2d') regridded_nn = regridder_nn(ds['your_variable']) regridded_nn.to_netcdf('output_nearest.nc') 4. Considerations Working with Large Datasets Regridding large datasets (e.g., high-resolution satellite data or long time series) can be memory- and compute-intensive. Here are some tips to improve performance: Use Dask for Chunking : xarray and xESMF support dask arrays, which allow you to process data in chunks and parallelize operations. Open your dataset with chunking: ```python ds = xr.open_dataset('input_data.nc', chunks={'time': 10, 'lat': 100, 'lon': 100}) Adjust chunk sizes to fit your memory and data shape ``` Saving and Reusing Regridding Weights : When you create a regridder in xESMF, it computes a weight matrix that maps the source grid to the target grid. This computation can be slow for large grids, but you can save the weights to a file and reload them later for faster repeated regridding. Example: ```python First time: compute and save weights regridder = xe.Regridder(ds, target_grid, 'bilinear', filename='my_weights.nc') Next time: reuse the saved weights (much faster) regridder = xe.Regridder(ds, target_grid, 'bilinear', filename='my_weights.nc', reuse_weights=True) ``` This is especially useful when you need to regrid many variables or process data in chunks, as you only need to compute the weights once. Parallel Processing : If you have access to a cluster or multicore machine, dask can distribute the computation. Set up a dask cluster for even faster processing. Reduce Data Size : If possible, subset your data in time or space before regridding, or use coarser grids for exploratory analysis. Monitor Memory Usage : Large regridding operations can use a lot of RAM. Monitor your system and adjust chunk sizes or process data in smaller batches if needed. For more details, see the xESMF documentation on dask and performance . 5. Visualizing the Results import matplotlib.pyplot as plt regridded.plot() plt.title('Regridded Data (Bilinear)') plt.show() Comparing Input and Output You can compare the original and regridded data side by side: fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5)) ds['your_variable'].plot(ax=axs[0]) axs[0].set_title('Original Data') regridded.plot(ax=axs[1]) axs[1].set_title('Regridded Data (Bilinear)') plt.tight_layout() plt.show() For more advanced analysis, you can plot the difference: diff = regridded - ds['your_variable'].interp_like(regridded) diff.plot() plt.title('Difference After Regridding') plt.show() 6.
